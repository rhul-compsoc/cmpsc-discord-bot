# API "Documentation"
The entire API will hide behind the "slug" given in the config.

This slug will prefix all further API routes.

## Authentication

All connections to the API must have a `X-Auth-Token` header.  This is a secret and will grant full access to this API.

The header must contain the token in base-64 encoding.

The `/hello` endpoint can be used to test the configuration.  Successful connections will return `"hi!"`

## Routes

 - GET `/getmembers/<guildid>` -> deprecated; same as GET `/guild/<guildid>/members`
 - `/guild/<guildid>/` contains the following endpoints:
   - GET `/info` -> returns the guild data
   - GET `/members` -> returns information on all members of this guild
